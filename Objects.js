// 1-define objects for 5 of your classmater containing the following keys:
	// -full name 
	// -age 
	// -favorite sports 
	// -nationality
	// and then save theme in one array called mates!

 var fatima=({ full_name: "fatima almostafa" ,age:"22",favourit_sports:"basket ball",nationality:"syrian" })
 var samer=({full_name: "samer salmeh" ,age:"25",favourit_sports:"football",nationality:"syrian" })

 var shefaa=({full_name: "shefa almostafa" ,age:"17",favourit_sports:"basketball",nationality:"syrian" })
  
  var mansour=({full_name: "mansour hjgh" ,age:"23",favourit_sports:"tennis",nationality:"syrian" })
var sara=({full_name: "sara hjgh" ,age:"227",favourit_sports:"tennis",nationality:"syrian" })
var mates[];
 
 mates.push (fatima);
 mates.push (khadija);
 mates.push (shefaa);
 mates.push (mansour);
 mates.push (samer);


// 2-depending on the previous exercises , write a function that returns the older classmate from mates array.
function older classmate (){
	

}
// 3-write a function that takes an object as argument and returns how many keys does that object contain.
	 nbOfObjKeys({}) // ==> 0
	 nbOfObjKeys({name:"housam",age:"3"}) // ==> 2

// if you finished the above, solve the following:
// write a function that takes array of strings and returns an array of the strings that have the same length
	    ['hi','hello','welcome','hy'] // ==> ["hi","hy"]
