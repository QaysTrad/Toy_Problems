// 1-define objects for 5 of your classmater containing the following keys:
	// -full name 
	// -age 
	// -favorite sports 
	// -nationality
	// and then save theme in one array called mates!
	var friends={
			fullName:"Ather Mahmoud" , "Monther ", "Mohammad Derani "," Samer Salma","Nader Nasor"
			age:34,22,25,,24,27 
			favorieSports:"Flying Disk " ,"  ", " "
			nationality:" Iraq"," "
	}
	var mates=[friends]

// 2-depending on the previous exercises , write a function that returns the older classmate from mates array.
	
	function older(){     // ideas for solution : shall use while loop to navigate inside(age)
							//	and put a condition which return to me the larger one ,its by if statment 
							// then it return by invok the age key with its value : (friend.age)
		for(var n=1; n<)
	}

// 3-write a function that takes an object as argument and returns how many keys does that object contain.
	 nbOfObjKeys({}) // ==> 0
	 nbOfObjKeys({name:"housam",age:"3"}) // ==> 2

// if you finished the above, solve the following:
// write a function that takes array of strings and returns an array of the strings that have the same length
	    ['hi','hello','welcome','hy'] // ==> ["hi","hy"]
